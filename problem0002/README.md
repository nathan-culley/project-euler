Problem Description:

"Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."

Solution 0002A:

This solution uses only one function (createFib), which has a for loop that starts at index = 1, checks the index for divisibility by 2, adds the index to a running sum, and then adds the index to itself and repeats the process until index is greater than 4 million. The maximum number is declared as maxNumber at the start of the program, so all that is required is to change the value of maxNumber to see a different sum of even Fibonacci terms.
