            <h3>What is Project Euler?</h3>
                <p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is an online programming and math challenge that has published several hundred mathematical problems that are impossible (or at least extremely difficult) to solve without the aid of computers. For each problem, the goal is to create a program that arrives at the correct solution, which can be verified on Project Euler's website if you have an account there.</p>
                <p>For an advanced example of a problem requiring computation to solve, consider <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=615">Problem 615</a> (which I am personally very far from being able to solve):</p>
                <blockquote id="example-problem" cite="https://projecteuler.net/problem=61">
                <p>Consider the natural numbers having at least 5 prime factors, which don't have to be distinct. Sorting these numbers by size gives a list which starts with:</p>
                <p>32=2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2</p>
                <p>48=2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅3</p>
                <p>64=2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2</p>
                <p>72=2⋅2⋅2⋅3⋅3</p>
                <p>80=2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅5</p>
                <p>96=2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅3</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>So, for example, the fifth number with at least 5 prime factors is 80.</p>
                <p>Find the millionth number with at least one million prime factors. Give your answer modulo 123454321.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As of this writing, I am learning full-stack web development, so every solution so far has been written in JavaScript. Project Euler prefers to encourage people to learn the problems themselves and arrive at their own solutions, but allows people to publish their results up through the first 100 problems if done for the purposes of education. My goal here is to illustrate the mathematical and computational principles at work as best I can, and show how I implemented them to solve the problems.</p>
