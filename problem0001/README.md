Problem Description:

"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

Solution 0001A:

Simple JavaScript program that prints the results in the console of an HTML page. Sets a counter=0 that runs up to 1000 and checks each number for divisibility by 3 and 5, then adds each one that fits the criteria to a new variable "sum."
