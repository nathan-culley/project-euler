# project-euler
A collection of solutions to Project Euler problems.

Problem 0001: "Multiples of 3 or 5"
"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

Solution 0001.A: JavaScript in HTML file. Loop all integers below 1000, checking each for modulus 0 when divided by 3 and 5. Add integers meeting criteria to a running sum, then return the sum when 1000 is reached.
